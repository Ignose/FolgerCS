# FolgerCS - Seraphiii

`FolgerCS` is a softcore one-day Community Service script meant for looping in Kingdom of Loathing, and designed to work for mid-shiny accounts (i.e. accounts with more than a full standard set) with extra features for mid-to-high shiny accounts (i.e. accounts with a lot more than a full standard set). The user is expected to have a bunch of softcore-permed skills, and at least many IotMs in order to enable this (one of which is the [Clan VIP Lounge key](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_key)).

Update: Preferences are now done via the relay. If you previously set preferences for this script, they must be reset.

## Installation

To install the script, use the following command in the KoLMafia CLI.

```text
git checkout https://github.com/Ignose/FolgerCS.git release
```

## Usage

This version was designed by me, Seraphiii, for me, Seraphiii. If you are not me, Seraphiii, it will not perform as well for you.
